Doctor: I'm sorry to hear you have a broken arm. This can be a painful injury that requires proper care to heal correctly. The most common symptoms of a broken arm include severe pain, swelling, bruising, deformity, and difficulty moving the arm.

It's important to seek medical attention promptly for a broken arm to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, here are some steps you can take:

1. Immobilize the arm: Use a makeshift sling or hold the injured arm close to your body to prevent further movement.

2. Apply ice: Use an ice pack wrapped in a towel for 15-20 minutes at a time to help reduce swelling and pain.

3. Elevate the arm: Keep your arm elevated above heart level to help minimize swelling.

4. Take over-the-counter pain medication: Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help manage pain and inflammation.

Treatment for a broken arm typically involves realigning the bone if needed and immobilizing it with a cast or splint to allow proper healing. The healing process usually takes about 6-8 weeks, depending on the severity of the break.

For pain management, your doctor may recommend:

***
P: Ibuprofen

N: Arm fracture
