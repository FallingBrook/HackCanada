Therapist: I hear that you're feeling really sad about being fired. That's totally understandable - losing a job can bring up all kinds of difficult emotions. What do you think is hitting you the hardest about this situation right now? Sometimes when we dig a little deeper, we can start to unpack those feelings and find ways to move forward. Is there anything positive you can take away from this experience, even if it doesn't feel that way in the moment? I know it's tough, but try to be gentle with yourself as you process this. You're going through a big transition and it's okay to have ups and downs. What kind of support do you have around you right now?
